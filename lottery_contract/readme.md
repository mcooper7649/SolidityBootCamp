## The Lottery Contract
---

1. For out next Contract we want to create a lottery app.
    - We wil  create a price pool with a set limit of eth
    - We will allow participants to put eth into the prize pool until a specific amount has been reached.
    - A Manager will then tell the contract to pick a winner of the lottery
    - Logic will handle that from the contracts end
    - Contract will pay out the winner


## Lottery Design
---

There two major things to consider when creating our contract
- Variables
    - Name
        - manager // only the manager can tell the contract to pick a winner
        - players //  
    - Purpose
        - address of person who created the contract
        - Array of addressed of people who have entered
- Functions
    - Name
        - enter // a name that describes a player entering the lottery
        - pickWinner // a name that describes a manager picking a winner
    - Purpose
        - Enters a player into the lottery
        - Randomly picks a winner and send them the prize pool


## Basic Solidity Types
---

1. We need to set the datatypes of our variable first
    - for a wallet address, like manager, it would be 'address'

2. Other Basic Types include
    - string
    - bool
    - int 
        - integer, positive or negative. Has no decimal
        - you might run into int8, int16, int32. This is just referencing bits specify how many number are potentialy available in the range
        - int is an alias of int256
    - uint
        - Unsigned integer, positive number, Has no decimal
    - fixed/ufixed
        - 'Fixed' point number. Numbner weith a decimal after it
    - address
        - has methods tied to it for sending money
